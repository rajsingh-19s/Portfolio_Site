            <p>Welcome to the world of HTML, the backbone of every web page you see on the internet. Whether youâ€™re a complete beginner or looking to brush up on your skills, this guide will help you embark on your HTML adventure. Letâ€™s dive in!
                <span class="dots">...</span>
                <span class="more"><br>
                    <br> What is HTML?<br>
                    <br>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the structure of a webpage, allowing you to format text, add images, create links, and much more. Think of HTML as the <br>skeleton of a webpage, giving it shape and form.

                   <br> Basic Structure of an HTML Document<br>
                   <br>Every HTML document starts with a &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; declaration, followed by the &lt;html&gt; tag. Inside the &lt;html&gt; tag, there are two main sections: &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt;.

                   <br>Hereâ€™s a simple example:<br>

                   <br>HTML<br>

                   <br>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                   <br>&lt;html&gt;
                   <br>&lt;head&gt;
                   <br> &lt;title&gt;My First Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
                   <br>&lt;/head&gt;
                   <br>&lt;body&gt;
                   <br>    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Website&lt;/h1&gt;
                   <br>    &lt;p&gt;This is my first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
                   <br>&lt;/body&gt;
                   <br>&lt;/html&gt;<br>

                   <br>Key HTML Elements<br>
                   <br>Headings: Used to define headings on your web page. There are six levels of headings, from &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;.
                   <br>HTML<br>

                   <br>&lt;h1&gt;This is a Heading&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
                   <br>&lt;h2&gt;This is a Subheading&lt;/h2&gt;<br>

                   <br>HTML<br>

                   <br>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

                   <br>HTML<br>

                   <br>&lt;a href="https://www.example.com"&gt;Visit Example&lt;/a&gt;
                   <br>HTML<br>

                   <br>&lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of Image"&gt;

                   <br>HTML<br>

                   <br>&lt;ul&gt;
                   <br>&lt;li&gt;Item 1&lt;/li&gt;
                   <br>  &lt;li&gt;Item 2&lt;/li&gt;
                   <br>&lt;/ul&gt;
                   <br>&lt;ol&gt;
                   <br>    &lt;li&gt;First item&lt;/li&gt;
                   <br>&lt;li&gt;Second item&lt;/li&gt;
                   <br>&lt;/ol&gt;<br>

                   <br>To create your first web page, follow these steps:<br>

                   <br>Open a Text Editor: You can use any text editor like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text.
                   <br>Write Your HTML Code: Use the basic structure and elements mentioned above.
                   <br>Save the File: Save your file with a .html extension, for example, index.html.
                   <br>Open in a Browser: Open the saved file in a web browser to see your web page in action!<br>
                   <br>Conclusion<br>
                   <br>HTML is the foundation of web development. By learning the basics, you can start creating your own web pages and explore more advanced topics like CSS and JavaScript to enhance your web development skills.
