        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div id="introPara"><p>Hello! <span id="name">I’m Rajkumar Singh</span> , a dedicated and enthusiastic frontend developer with a robust skill set in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br> My journey in web development began with a fascination for how websites are built and a desire to create visually appealing and highly functional user interfaces.<br> Over the years, I have honed my skills to ensure that every project I work on not only meets but exceeds user expectations.<br>

            My expertise in HTML allows me to structure web content effectively, ensuring that it is both accessible and SEO-friendly.<br> With CSS, I bring designs to life, creating responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly to different devices and screen sizes.<br> I am adept at using modern CSS techniques, including Flexbox and Grid, to build complex layouts with ease.<br> JavaScript is where I add interactivity and dynamic functionality to my projects.<br> Whether it’s creating smooth animations, handling user inputs, or fetching data from APIs, I leverage JavaScript to enhance the user experience.<br>
            
            In addition to my core frontend skills, I am proficient in using Git for version control.<br> This allows me to manage code changes efficiently, collaborate with other developers, and maintain a clean and organized codebase.<br> GitHub is my go-to platform for hosting and sharing my projects.<br> I am comfortable with branching, merging, and handling pull requests, which are essential for collaborative development.<br>
            
            I am a firm believer in continuous learning and staying updated with the latest trends and technologies in web development.<br> I regularly participate in online courses, attend webinars, and follow industry blogs to keep my skills sharp and relevant.<br> This proactive approach ensures that I am always ready to tackle new challenges and implement the best practices in my work.<br>
            
            One of my key strengths is my attention to detail.<br> I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and ensuring that every element on a webpage is pixel-perfect.<br> I also have a keen eye for design and usability, which helps me create interfaces that are not only visually appealing but also intuitive and user-friendly.<br>
            
            Collaboration is at the heart of my work ethic.<br> I enjoy working in team environments where ideas are shared, and creativity is encouraged.<br> I believe that the best solutions come from diverse perspectives and open communication.<br> Whether it’s brainstorming new features, debugging issues, or optimizing performance, I am always ready to contribute and support my team.<br>
            
            In summary, I am a passionate frontend developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and version control using Git and GitHub.<br> I am committed to delivering high-quality web experiences and continuously improving my skills.<br> Let’s connect and create something amazing together!<br></p>
